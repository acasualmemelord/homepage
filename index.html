  <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07419">The Naming Game</a> is an experiment investigating agent dynamics of naming objects: can a group of agents autonomously agree upon a name without the influence of a central authority?
  In a group of four engaged in Agile development, I coded the backend of a program simulating this question.</p>
