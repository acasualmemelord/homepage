  <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07419">The Naming Game</a> is an experiment investigating agent dynamics of naming objects: can a group of agents autonomously agree upon a name without the influence of a central authority?
  In a group of four engaged in Agile development, I coded the backend of a program simulating this question.</p>

  <p>You land in a checkboard green landscape surrounded by obstacles with one objective: find the hole. But when you go down the hole, you land in the same field of green, now with different obstacles.<br>
    Play golf, forever.
